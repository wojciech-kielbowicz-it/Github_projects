Welcome to my Github profile.

This repository is intended to showcase my skills and serve as a portfolio.

However, I encourage anyone who ventures into these areas of Github to leave comments in the comments after analyzing my code, 
as I will be happy to benefit from the knowledge of people who may have a greater understanding of data science, 
supplementing my skills and knowledge with new aspects.

I wish you pleasant browsing and best regards,
