    "This module implements an LLM-based (Large Language Model) agent to automate personalized marketing communication. Below are the key technical decisions and the rationale behind the chosen data flow architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulation Mode (\"Dry Run\") & Data Safety\n",
    "For safety reasons and development purposes, no actual emails are transmitted to customer addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Process: Generated content is stored directly within the pandas.DataFrame as a new feature (e.g., email_draft).\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistence: Upon completion, the enriched dataset is exported to a .csv / .parquet file. This allows for a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach, where drafts undergo Quality Assurance (QA) before any potential production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sequential Execution Strategy (Single-Threaded)\n",
    "The system utilizes the pandas .apply() method for row-by-row processing. While vectorization is typically preferred in Data Science for performance, sequential processing is the optimal architectural choice in this specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We deliberately avoided Parallel Processing (e.g., joblib, multiprocessing) due to the constraints of the Hugging Face Serverless Inference API (Free Tier):\n",
    "\n",
    "API Rate Limiting: The free tier imposes strict limits on the number of requests per second (QPS). Parallel execution would trigger simultaneous requests, resulting in immediate HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) errors and token suspension.\n",
    "\n",
    "I/O Bound Process: The bottleneck is not local CPU computation power, but Network Latency (waiting for the server to generate text).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic Control: Using a sequential loop within .apply() allows for precise pacing via time.sleep(). This ensures the script respects the API's concurrency limits and maintains stability throughout the ETL process."
